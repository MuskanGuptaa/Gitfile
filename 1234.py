Git is the most popular, open-source, widely used, and an example of distributed version control system (DVCS) used for handling the development of small and large projects in a more efficient and neat manner.
It is most suitable when there are multiple people working on projects as a team and is used for tracking the project changes and efficiently supports the collaboration of the development process.
With the help of the versioning system, the developer can identify who has made what changes and then run tests and fix bugs if any and then do necessary feature implementation.
In case of any unforeseen circumstances, the code can be reverted to any of the previously working versions thereby saving huge efforts.

1. What is a version control system (VCS)?
A VCS keeps track of the contributions of the developers working as a team on the projects. \
They maintain the history of code changes done and with project evolution,
it gives an upper hand to the developers to introduce new code, fixes bugs, 
and run tests with confidence that their previously working copy could be restored at any moment in case things go wrong.

2. What is a git repository?
A repository is a file structure where git stores all the project-based files. Git can either stores the files on the local or the remote repository.

3. What does git clone do?
The command creates a copy (or clone) of an existing git repository. 
Generally, it is used to get a copy of the remote repository to the local repository.
