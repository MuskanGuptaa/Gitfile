Git is the most popular, open-source, widely used, and an example of distributed version control system (DVCS) used for handling the development of small and large projects in a more efficient and neat manner.
It is most suitable when there are multiple people working on projects as a team and is used for tracking the project changes and efficiently supports the collaboration of the development process.
With the help of the versioning system, the developer can identify who has made what changes and then run tests and fix bugs if any and then do necessary feature implementation.
In case of any unforeseen circumstances, the code can be reverted to any of the previously working versions thereby saving huge efforts.

Due to a well-established version control system and the support for collaborative work, git has garnered wide popularity not just amongst the software developers, but also among the people who do other tasks like documentation or 
any other collaborative work. It can seem challenging at first, but once we get the hang of git, we find that it makes our lives much simpler.
